Test Electron

In this directory we run the project by compiling the modules using rollup.

To bundle, go to the "bundle" directory an type "num run build". This will package the sources into a commonJS module. This
module is usedd directly by our electron code.

To run the program type "npm start" in the local "text-electron" directory.
