to deploy:

npm run build

NOTES
- For now I can edit the rollup config file to create the chart es module or make the output libraries
- The output libraries currently use the constructed es6 module. I can get rid of some code there to load the npm
- I need to clean this up so I don't need to comment out to decide what to release.
