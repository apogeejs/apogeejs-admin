Prosemirror Lib
------------

This is the plain source from the prosemirror libraries, as taken from github. Any package and testing code was removed.
As is, this can be used as ES6 modules.

A few external links have been packaged from npm as es6 modules.

Finally, any dependencies have been updated to point to the ES6 modules rather than using npm.

The prose mirror releases used were the current releases as of 9/2/19.
