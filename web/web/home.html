        <h2>Motivation for Hax</h2>
        <p>
            The motivation behind Hax was to make it easier to write real code in a spreadsheet-like tool.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The variables names from a spreadsheet, such as <b><em>B$5</em></b>, are replaced with descriptive names such as 
                <b><em>revenue</em></b> to make the code more understandable.</li>
            <li>The formulas are applied to entire data structures, so <b>loops or recursive functions</b> can be used, rather than
                        <b>copying and pasting</b> formulas over a range of cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These new features make the tool more of a coding environment. Admittedly there is
            extra overhead in writing this code. For simple models, the spreadsheet is easier.
            However, once the model gets more complex, it is much easier to organize, debug and 
            maintain in Hax.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Hax runs completely in the browser and is written in javascript. The user scripting language
            is also javascript.
        </p>
        <p>Because Hax is uses javascript, the data format for data structures is JSON. This is a convenient
            because JSON is one of the most prevelent data formats, such as for metadata files and data transfer
            in web services.    
        </p>
        
        <p>ADD COMPATIBILITY!!! - browsers and javascript versions</p>
        
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        (make links to example pages here)
       
        <br>
        ALSO TO DO:<br>
        - links at top of page, including to the actual App!<br>
        - prettier header, standardized over example pages.<br>
        - quick start?<br>
        - documentation?<br>
