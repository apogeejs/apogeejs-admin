Demo Notes
----------

- Here we relate plotting this data in apogee to plotting data in a normal programming environment.
-- We do this to show how programming in Apogee relates to normal software environments, and to show
how it differs.
-- There are two main areas where it differs
---The setup involved in starting a calculation.
----Different environments will have different setup. Apogee makes setup very easy in certain cases. The web page+plain javascript requires a
lot of setup and is seldom used for this calculation. We won't try to compare the two. 
---The process of writing the code - interactive and iterative. You can see the data you are working with and you can see it change while you work.
-- An additional minor area.
---The program flow - this is handled automatically in apogee

--At the same time, there are certainly ways and corresponding use cases where traditional environments are better. We want to show the cases where apogee works well. (List some)
